\section{Ethical Considerations}
Attacks as described in this thesis can cause considerable harm to individuals, companies, and communities. For all the reasons explained and examples brought up in section \ref{TheDangersOfUSB} these attacks are not to be taken lightly and the potential for damage is real. For this exact reason it is important to raise awareness for this kind of attack, research existing vulnerabilities, new developments in the field, and how those can be counteracted. Investigating attacks in particular ones that are not available in a public GitHub repository is an important contribution to the scientific field and outweighs the negative. Just because these payloads cannot easily be found, does not mean they do not already exist. Which arguably makes them even more dangerous to the public and therefore their exploration is even more urgent. \\
In section \ref{HistoryOfDefense} this thesis explains countermeasures that can be put in place to protect oneself and in section \ref{Defence Methodology} a defense architecture will be presented, specifically against the O.MG cable introduced in section \ref{Background}.
% bring up the balck/white /grey hat discussion again? or is his not scientific enough?
