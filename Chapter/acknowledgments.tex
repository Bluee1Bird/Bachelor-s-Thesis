I want to express my gratitude to my supervisor Mr. Thomas Gr\"ubl for his support, feedback, input, and expertise that I was allowed to benefit from throughout the course of writing my thesis. I am grateful for his willingness to take up my proposal and his guidance to make it a reality.

Furthermore, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller for providing me with the opportunity to write my thesis at his research group, the Communications Systems Group (CSG) at the University of Z\"urich.

Additionally, I would like to thank the developers and engineers of Hak5, Mischief Gadgets and NirSoft. I want to specifically mention MG and Kalani who helped me navigate some of the pitfalls of the USB protocol.

Special thanks to Samir Saad for his inputs and the idea for this thesis. 

Lastly, I am profoundly thankful to my family and friends for supporting me in the last six months.
